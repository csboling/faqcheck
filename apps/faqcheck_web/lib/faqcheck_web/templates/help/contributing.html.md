# Providing new translations for the app

FaqCheck is intended to allow translating all the text parts of the app, such as table headers or captions on forms, into many different languages. This is accomplished using a program called [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/), which reads .po files to gather translations for each bit of text. These files are [part of the FaqCheck source code](https://github.com/csboling/faqcheck/tree/main/apps/faqcheck_web/priv/gettext), and contributions can be made by [submitting a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) that modifies these files.

## Updating an existing translation

To add or update translations for a language which already has some translations, you can edit the .po files in the corresponding LC_MESSAGES folder under the folder named after the language abbreviation. For example, Chinese translations for messages are in `gettext/zh/LC_MESSAGES/default.po` and `gettext/zh/LC_MESSAGES/errors.po`.

For each message, the `msgid` value gives the English version of the message. The line above the msgid shows where in the [FaqCheck web app source code](https://github.com/csboling/faqcheck/tree/main/apps/faqcheck_web) this message appears. The `msgstr` value should be edited to contain, between the double-quote marks `""`, a translation to the language indicated by the language code.

Messages may also contain placeholder values, which are labels inside `%{}` characters. These placeholders will be replaced with text generated from the FaqCheck app's database, for instance the name or phone number of an agency, which will appear as-is in the position of the placeholder.

```
#, elixir-format
#: lib/faqcheck_web/templates/page/index.html.eex:2
msgid "%{page_size} items per page"
msgstr "每页有%{page_size}个项目"
```

Items with empty translations will be displayed in the app in English as a fallback.

## Adding a new translation

If you want to contribute translations for a language FaqCheck doesn't support yet, thank you! Please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/csboling/faqcheck/issues) so it stays on the radar. A developer can add the new files for you, or if you have a development setup for modifying the FaqCheck source code, a new file can be generated by running the `mix gettext.merge` command in the [`apps/faqcheck_web` folder](https://github.com/csboling/faqcheck/tree/main/apps/faqcheck_web). For instance:

```
mix gettext.merge priv/gettext --locale ru
```

to add .po files for a Russian translation. After this is generated, you will also need to add a translation for `msgid "LANGUAGE_NAME"` to tell FaqCheck how to display the name of the language.
